**BOSH SoftLayer Pool Server Release**
-------------

BOSH SoftLayer pool server provides APIs to utilize virtual guests pooling on SoftLayer. This is a BOSH release for it.

**Releases and stemcells**
-------------
The following releases are dependencies.

- [postgres](http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release) 
- [bosh-softlayer-cpi](http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-softlayer-cpi-release) 

SoftLayer light stemcell is needed for deployment and can be found the [latest version](https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-softlayer-xen-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent) on bosh.io.

**Bootstrap on SoftLayer**
-------------
You can use bosh-init from BOSH community to bootstrap a pool server on SoftLayer. 

> **Warning:** To fully enable virtual guest pooling on SoftLayer, except deploying a pool server, you also need to make director to connect to it and enable pooling feature. Please refer to release note of [bosh-softlayer-cpi-release v3.0.1](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-softlayer-cpi-release/releases/tag/v3.0.1).

> **Note:** 
> In BOSH CLI v2, bosh-init is deprecated and use `bosh create-env` instead(We'll update when BOSH CLI v2 releases).

- To install bosh-init, please refer to [install-bosh-init](http://bosh.io/docs/install-bosh-init.html) and its usage can be found in [using-bosh-init](http://bosh.io/docs/using-bosh-init.html).
> **Note:**
>  Please make sure the machine installed bosh-init can access SoftLayer private network and you can enable SoftLayer VPN if it is outside of SoftLayer data center. This is because it needs to communicate with the target VM over SoftLayer private network to accomplish a successful deployment.

- Prepare a deployment manifest

You can find a deployment manifest example under docs named [vps-init-example.yml](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/bosh-softlayer-pool-server-release/tree/develop/docs) which can deploy a virtual guest pooling server and please replace release, stemcell, resource and credential information accordingly.
> **Note:**
>  For releases and stemcells, please either use url like the example manifest does or download them to your local machine and specify its location.
